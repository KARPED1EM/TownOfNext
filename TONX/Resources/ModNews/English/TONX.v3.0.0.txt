#ShortTitle:★TONX v3.0.0
#Date:2023-11-16T00:00:00Z
#-----------------------------

## Base
- Base on AmongUs v2023.10.24
- Base on TOH v5.1.3

## Warning
- Create/join public lobbies is temporarily unavailable
- This change is due to a server-side update that makes modded public lobbies unavailable for vanilla. Private lobbies are not affected.
- Currently, this change is NOT permanent.

## You know what
- We completely reconstructed TOHE based on the new Base after TOH v5.0.0, so all 113 roles were rewritten.
- TONX may have a lot of bugs. If possible, please report bugs in time and attach logs.
- In addition, according to the logic of the new Base, some roles conflicts in the original version may be changed from not triggering to mandatory execution.
- Therefore, the new version of TONX may have subtle rule differences in some role skill conflicts.

## To Do
- Some neutral roles have not been rewritten yet

## Cloud Service
- EAC cloud service not working yet
- The update check service uses files in customized formats and can be automatically obtained from multiple channels
