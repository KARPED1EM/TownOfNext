#内鬼阵营 / Long Impostors descriptions
BountyHunterInfoLong: "If you kill your indicated target, your next kill cooldown will be greatly reduced.\nIf you kill anyone other than your target, your next kill cooldown will increase.\nThe target swaps after a configurable amount of time."
FireworkerInfoLong: "Whenever you shapeshift, you can place a firework.\nAfter placing all fireworks, you can set them all off at once when you shapeshift once you become the last impostor.\nOnce you start placing fireworks, you cannot kill until the fireworks go off."
SerialKillerInfoLong: "You have a shorter kill cooldown than other impostors, but you will die if you don't kill before the end of your shape-shift cooldown."
ShapeMasterInfoLong: "The Shape Master has no Shapeshift cooldown, but their default Shapeshift duration is shorter."
MareInfoLong: "You can only kill during the Lights Sabotage.\nYour Kill Cooldown is shorter though.\nDuring Fix Lights, you can move faster, but your name will be displayed in red for everyone."
VampireInfoLong: "The bitten target of the Vampire will not die immediately, but will die suddenly after a delay. If a meeting is called within this time, the target will die immediately. If you bite a Bait, you make a normal kill and you're forced to self-report."
WarlockInfoLong: "The Warlock can curse another players while not Shapeshifted.\nWhen they Shapeshift after cursing, the player closest to the cursed player is killed no matter how far away they are.\nWhile Shapeshifting, you can perform normal kills.\nOnly 1 player can be cursed at a time."
ZombieInfoLong: "Zombie has a short kill cooldown, but moves very slowly and has very little vision. Zombie will not be voted out by anyone other than the Dictator, and the movement speed of Zombie will gradually slow down as they make kills or time passes."
AssassinInfoLong: "The Ninja can use the kill button to mark a target, and if the mark is successful, a shield-animation will be displayed as a reminder. The Ninja can then use shapeshift to teleport to the marked person and kill the marked person. Ninja cannot kill regularly, but may be able to kill regularly after assassination according to the host's settings."
HackerInfoLong: "The Hacker can use shapeshift to hack into the shapeshifting target. The hacked target will immediately report the body killed by the Hacker in this round. If there is no dead body, the target will report its own dead body (the effect is similar to Paranoid). Note: hacking ignores whether a body can be reported. Also, hacking Lazy Guy won't do things for you, hacking Lazy Guy just wastes your time."
MinerInfoLong: "Miner can shapeshift to teleport back to the last vent they were in."
KillingMachineInfoLong: "The Killing Machine has a very short kill cooldown, but cannot vent, has lower vision, cannot sabotage, cannot report, and cannot call emergency meetings. The Killing Machine also has the same vision as Crewmates."
EscapistInfoLong: "Escapist can mark a location by shapeshifting, and they will be teleported to the marked location when they shapeshift again (not when unshifting)."
WitchInfoLong: "The Spellcaster has two attack methods: direct killing and spelling. Pressing the kill button twice quickly will result in a normal kill, and pressing the kill button only once will cast a spell on that player. During the next meeting, the spelled target(s) will have a 「†」 mark next to their name which is visible to everyone. If the Spellcaster is not ejected or killed by the end of the meeting, all players that have been spelled die when the meeting ends."
MafiaInfoLong: "Mafia can't kill while there are other Impostors alive in the game, but can use command /rv [player id] after death to kill the specified player."
PuppeteerInfoLong: "The player controlled by the Puppeteer will kill the next non-impostor player that shows up closest to them. If the latter dies on contact, the former dies. Puppeteers cannot kill normally. Note that Lazy Guy will not do things for you, controlling Lazy Guy will only waste your time."
TimeThiefInfoLong: "Every time the Time Thief kills a player, the meeting time will be reduced by a certain amount of time. If the Time Thief dies, the meeting time will return to normal."
SniperInfoLong: "You can shoot players from far away.\nYou have to shapeshift twice to make a successful snipe.\nImagine an arrow pointing from your first shapeshift location towards your unshift location.\nThat will be the direction in which the snipe will be made.\nThe snipe kills the first person in its path.\nYou cannot kill normally until you use up all of your ammos."
EvilTrackerInfoLong: "The Evil Tracker can track other people, and the tracker can shapeshift into someone to switch the tracking target to the shapeshift target (You will immediately unshift after performing shapeshift). The arrow below the Evil Tracker's name indicates the direction of the target. When the Evil Tracker's teammate kills, the Evil Tracker will see a kill-flash."
EvilGuesserInfoLong: "The Evil Guesser can guess the role of a certain player during the meeting. If it is correct, the target dies, and if it is wrong, the Evil Guesser dies.\nThe guessing command is: /bt [player id] [role]\nYou can see the player's id before the player's name, or use the /id command to view the id of all players."
AntiAdminerInfoLong: "The Anti Adminer can at any time find out if there are crewmates or neutrals near Cameras, Admin Table, Vitals, DoorLog and/or other devices. Note: Anti Adminer does not know for sure if the player is using the device while near it, they only know that someone is near the device."
ArroganceInfoLong: "The Arrogance reduces their kill cooldown with each successful kill of theirs."
BomberInfoLong: "The Bomber can use the shapeshift button to self-explode, killing players within a certain range. But as a price, the Bomber will also die. Note: All players will see a kill-flash when the Bomber explodes."
ScavengerInfoLong: "Scavenger kills do not leave dead bodies behind. In addition, if the victim is a bait, no self-report will be made."
BoobyTrapInfoLong: "The Trapster will put a trap on the victim's body after killing, and the player who reports the dead body with the Trapster will be killed immediately (the body doesn't get reported), and the player who is killed will also have the effect of Trapsters, and so on. But as a price, the Trapster will die immediately after making a kill. Note: The Trapster doesn't have a Trapster effect on their own dead body."
CapitalistInfoLong: "Capitalists can add a short task to a player by pressing the kill button. Note: using this ability on players who have no tasks or have completed tasks will not take effect."
GangsterInfoLong: "The Gangster can attempt to recruit a player to a Madmate by pressing the kill button. If the recruitment is successful, both the Gangster and the target will see the shield animation on each other as a reminder (only visible to each other). The remaining number of available recruits is displayed next to the Gangster's name (the max is set by the host). If the Gangster tries to recruit players who cannot be recruited, such as neutrals or some special crews, they will kill the target normally instead. When the Gangster has no remaining recruitments, they can only make normal kills from that point on."
CleanerInfoLong: "Cleaner can press the Report button to clean up any dead body they come across (including those they kill). If the cleanup is successful, the Cleaner will see a shield-animation on his body as a reminder (only visible to himself). The cleaned up body cannot be reported (including bait's)."
BallLightningInfoLong: "The Lightning cannot do regular kills. After the Lightning uses their kill button on the target, the target will vaporize into a quantum ghost after a set time, and everyone can see the 「■」 next to the name of the quantum ghost as a reminder. If there is non-spherical lightning and a player who is not a quantum ghost touches the quantum ghost, the quantum ghost will be quantized immediately and die. If the quantum ghost survives until a meeting, they will die after the meeting ends. During this time, any active interaction (kill button) with the quantum ghost has no effect. According to the host's settings, killing the Lightning may cause the killer to vaporize into a quantum ghost."
GreedyInfoLong: "Greedy kills with odd and even kills will have different kill cooldowns. Greedy's kill cooldown is reset every meeting, and Greedy's first kill is always an odd kill."
CursedWolfInfoLong: "When the CursedWolf is about to be killed, the CursedWolf will curse the killer to death. (The max of times you can counterattack is set by the host)"
SoulCatcherInfoLong: "Soul Catcher can swap places with the shapeshift target after shapeshifting. (If the target is in an abnormal state such as dead, swallowed by pelican, venting, etc., then nothing will happen)"
QuickShooterInfoLong: "When the kill cooldown is up, the fast shooter can reset the kill cooldown by shapeshifting and saving the bullet (when the save is successful, it will have a shield break animation visible only to itself). After Quick Shooter makes a kill, he can offset the kill reload time with bullets until he runs out of bullets. At the beginning of each encounter, the Quick Shooter can only leave a certain amount of ammo (the amount is set by the Host)."
ConcealerInfoLong: "When Camouflager uses Shapeshift, all players start to look exactly the same. This state ends when Camouflager reverts its shape-shifting. Note: the skills of communication sabotage camouflage and skills of Camouflager can be superimposed.\nSkill will be invalid if a meeting is held during the skill activation of the Camouflager."
EraserInfoLong: "Eraser can vote for any crew target at the meeting to erase the target's roles, and the erasure will take effect after the meeting ends. Note: Players whose skills are erased will always be considered a vanilla role, including the game result page."
ButcherInfoLong: "Butcher kills (including passive kills) have multiple dead bodies on targets, making it impossible to accurately identify other dead body when reporting. Note: Due to the principle of implementation, the killed target has to repeatedly display the animation of being killed. This animation cannot be skipped and cannot participate in the meeting normally during this period. In addition, if the Butcher kills the Avenger, the Avenger will revenges everyone in anger."
HangmanInfoLong: "Kills people by strangling them. Strangling ignores any kind of protection, like shield of a Medic, protection of Bodyguard and so on. Player who got stragnled will leave no body nor will activate any of perks, like Veteran's alert, the luck of Luckey. Doesn't appear for psychic."
SwooperInfoLong: "The Swooper can Vent to temporarily turn invisible and vent again to cancel their invisibility phase. This means the Swooper can never vent normally, even when swooping is on cooldown. (Note: The game will forcibly make you turn visible when the swoop duration ends, no matter if you vent or not.)"
CrewPostorInfoLong: "You kill the nearest player whenever you complete a task."
StealthInfoLong: "When the Stealth kills, players in the same room are blinded for a short while."
MessengerInfoLong: "The Messenger can get the last-minute admin information at the meeting beginning.\nUnoccupied rooms are not shown.\nA '★' marks rooms with impostors.\nRooms with dead-bodies are marked with the number of bodies.\ne.g.)★Cafeteria: 3(DEAD×1)"

InsiderInfoLong: "Insiders can see the profession, skill state and number of tasks for all people everywhere. By setting it is possible for insiders to see traitors after completing the specified number of killings."
#船员阵营 / Crewmates descriptions
LuckeyInfoLong: "When a player attempts to kill the Luckey, there is a probability for the Luckey to evade the kill, and the specific probability is set by the host. When the evasion takes effect, the killer will see the shield-animation on Luckey's body, but Luckey themselves will not know anything."
LazyGuyInfoLong: "Lazy Guy has only one task. In addition, Impostor's abilities can't affect the Lazy Guy, such as being a scapegoat for a Hacker, marked by a Warlock or Puppeteer, and more. Lazy Guy will not have any add-ons."
SuperStarInfoLong: "There will be a star logo(★) next to Super Star's nickname to let everyone know who Super Star is. In addition, the Super Star cannot be guessed by all the Guessing Roles. (The Guessers themselves will not die if they try to guess the Super Star)."
